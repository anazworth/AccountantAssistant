# Accountant Assistant

>Who would win in a fight, RSI or one Python script?

These Python scripts can help you to pull customer information from a folder of IRS Form 8300s into a single .csv file. The .csv file you create can then be used to mass produce Microsoft Word documents to notify customers.

You will probably need to adjust both scripts to better fit your needs!

Note: I'm not an accountant, I just wrote this to help out a friend.
